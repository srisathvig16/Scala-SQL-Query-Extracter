This repo is for extracting sql qureies from a scala file and returning it as output.
The main.py, main2.py, main3.py files are three different approaches to address this problem.
The input sample file with the scala script is uploaded as scala.txt
The outputs for these files are saved as query.sql, query2.sql, query3.sql respectively.
